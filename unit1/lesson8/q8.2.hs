Calculating Fibonacci numbers is perhaps the single most common example
of a recursive function.

The most straightforward definition is as follows:

fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

Like the Ackermann function, this implementation quickly explodes due
to the mutually recursive calls. But unlike the Ackermann function, thereâ€™s
a much more efficient way to compute the nth Fibonacci number. Write a function
fastFib, that can compute the 1,000th Fibonacci number nearly instantly. 

Hint: fastFib takes three arguments: n1, n2, and counter. To calculate the
1,000th Fibonacci number, you call fastFib 1 1 1000 and for the 5th,
you call fastFib 1 1 5.
