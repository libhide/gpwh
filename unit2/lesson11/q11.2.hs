{-

In Haskell, both tail and head have an error when called on an empty list. You can
write a version of tail that wonâ€™t fail but instead return an empty list when called on
an empty list. Can you write a version of head that returns an empty list when
called on an empty list? To answer this, start by writing out the type signatures of
both head and tail.

safeTail :: [a] -> [a]
safeTail [] = []
safeTail (x:xs) = xs

safeHead :: [a] -> a
-- We can't write a safeHead [] = [] as [] is not of type a
